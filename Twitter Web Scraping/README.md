Objective : To create a mini Dataset of around 5000 Tweets. For this, we need to scrape out Twitter using Scrapper.
In this , I have worked on this Idea using Two methods :

1. By using Selenium and Driver in Python
By using this method , I was facing the following Issues :
a) BOT wasn't stopping on its own, I have to work on the Code Termination as well. Also, Twitter Account should get logged out as well.
b) Also, the Number of Rows I want in my Dataset weren't coming up in the Output.
c) Since Selenium Library works on using XPATH, so sometimes, Code wasn't able to detect different XPATHs for different Steps.

2. By using Snscrape Library in Python
This library usage is easier in comparison to Selenium one, as per my opinion.

Below is the Files from both Approaches used...
